# Linear-Regression-Assignment
Linear Regression assignment from Upgrad

The Boom Bike case study has been carried out. The optimal linear regression model has been built and the inferences drawn.

The entire code base is in the Jupyter Notebook. See the [Code and analysis]([https://github.com/abhijit673/Linear-Regression-Assignment/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20Assignment%20-%20Bike%20Rental.ipynb).
The answers to the subjective questions are added to a document. See the [Subjective Q&A](https://github.com/abhijit673/Linear-Regression-Assignment/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20Subjective%20Q%20and%20A.pdf)
